This is a MakeUp Ultrafast shaders modification that aims to make this amazing shader even faster! This shader maintains good looks while having great performance. Adding so many customization and a Portuguse translation. It can be used both by people with potato PCs that want to enhance Minecraft Java visual, and by people with good PCs who want high frame rates with good graphics and sharp shadows.
